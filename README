To-Do App Project
Project Information
Name:RUTH TARIKU
Project Description
This is a simple to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, complete, delete, and filter tasks. Tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage so they don't disappear when you refresh the page.

Features
Add new tasks
Mark tasks as completed
Delete tasks
Filter tasks (All/Active/Completed)
Tasks save automatically
Dark theme with yellow highlights

Works on mobile and desktop

How to Use
Open index.html in your web browser
Type a task in the input field
Press Enter or click "Add"
Click the checkbox to mark a task complete
Click the trash icon to delete a task
Use the filter buttons to show different views

Files Included
index.html - The main HTML file
style.css - All the styling
script.js - All the JavaScript code

What I Learned
How to use JavaScript to make web pages interactive
How to save data in the browser (localStorage)
How to handle user events (clicks, keyboard)
How to make a responsive design
How to debug JavaScript code

Challenges I Faced
Getting the delete buttons to work on new tasks
Making sure tasks save properly
Understanding event delegation
Making it work on mobile phones

How I Solved Them
Used event delegation for dynamic elements
Tested localStorage with console.log()
Looked up examples online
Asked for help when stuck

Requirements Met
 Add tasks with Enter key and button
 Mark tasks complete (with strikethrough)
 Delete tasks individually
 Show how many tasks are left
 Save tasks between page refreshes
 Filter tasks (All/Active/Completed)
 Clean, readable code
 Works on different screen sizes

Extra Features Added
 Double-click to edit tasks
 Dark/light theme toggle
Keyboard shortcuts (1, 2, 3 for filters)
 Sample tasks button for testing
 Error messages for empty input

Testing Instructions
Open the app in Chrome or Firefox
Add a few tasks
Mark some as complete
Delete a task
Try the filter buttons
Refresh the page to see tasks are saved
Try on mobile or resize browser

Code Notes
I used comments to explain difficult parts
The code is organized into functions
I tried to use meaningful variable names
There might be some bugs I didn't find

Future Improvements
If I had more time, I would add:
Due dates for tasks
Drag and drop to reorder
Categories for tasks
Share tasks with others

Credits
Icons from Font Awesome
Color scheme inspired by JavaScript
Help from online tutorials and documentation

Declaration
I confirm that this is my own work, except where I have acknowledged help from other sources.
